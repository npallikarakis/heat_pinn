**Physics-Informed Neural Networks for solving the 1D heat equation**

A complete implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the 1D heat equation with time-varying boundary conditions using TensorFlow 2.x. 

**Problem Statement:**

We solve the following PDE on the domain x ∈ [0,1], t ∈ [0,1]:

∂u/∂t - ∂²u/∂x² = f(x,t)

Force Term: 
f(x,t) = (π² - (π/2)²)·sin(πx)·exp(-(π/2)²t) + 0.6π·x·cos(2πt)

Initial Condition:
u(x,0) = sin(πx)

Boundary Conditions:
u(0,t) = 0
u(1,t) = 0.3·sin(2πt)

Exact Solution:
u(x,t) = sin(πx)·exp(-(π/2)²t) + 0.3·x·sin(2πt)

This problem combines exponential decay (heat diffusion) with oscillatory boundary forcing, creating spatiotemporal dynamics.

🎯 **Key Features**
